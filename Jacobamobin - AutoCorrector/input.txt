I recived an email from my manager yesturday, and she said the projet deadline has been extended untill next week. However, we still need to compelete most of the tasks by Thursday so that the client can reveiw our progress. It's importent to ensure all detials are correct, especialy in the main report where any mistkes could affect the final delivery.

I've also noticed that the data we colleted last month had some inaccuraices, which will need to be resolved. I'll ask Tom to double-chek the numbers so that we can present the most up-to-date infoemation to the team. Once we have these corrections made, the report will be ready to send to the entire departmant.
