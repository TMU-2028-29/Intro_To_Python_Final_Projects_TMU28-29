## NOTICE - Join TMU Git Community 

Every week we will work on a new Github Project, this will normally be in the programming language that class of 2028/29 has just learned or is learning at the time of the project.

Everyone can contribute to any project, To create a project however you must be approved.

The purpose of this is to allow everyone to have simple projects that look great on our GitHub pages for future employers, if you commit and stick with it for a single semester you will have 12 projects committed to on your github.
